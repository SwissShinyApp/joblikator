1. The personal_data.csv should be self explanatory. You need a GPT token. Without this, you need to provide the CV highlights by yourself.

2. The language file contains the languages you have cvs in.

3. The job_type file contains all types of jobs you want to have a totally different CV. For example, I applies for jobs as Data Scientist and as Consultant, whereas I rearranged the experience entries and skills for each of them a bit. Each of these entries must have a corresponding folder in cv_data

4. The highlights are your 3 Highlights of the CV, which are printed in top. These are the default highlights. If you provide a GPT token, the system will take your job description and your CV text and recommend the best 3 highlights for each job.
